<br/>

###What this is:
This is merely an example of what is possible with graphs and ZGRViewer in Java.
I made this a long time ago for a friend, figured I'd upload it here just in case it was useful to someone.

<br/>

###How to run it:

1. Pull down the project
2. Navigate to the directory you pulled the project into
3. Run `gradlew run`

__or__

1. Pull down the project
2. Execute Startup.java

<br/>

###Note #1:
This application needs to create .dot & .svg files for ZGRViewer to visualize them.
For simplicity these are stored in a 'graphs' folder on your desktop.
